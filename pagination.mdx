title: "Pagination"
---

All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches via "list" API methods.
These list API methods share a common structure, taking at least these three parameters: `take`, `skip`, and `orderBy`.

The response of a list API method represents a single page in a reverse chronological stream of objects.
If you do not specify any parameters, you will receive the first page of this stream, containing the newest objects.
The limit of objects you can receive is set to 100.

Along with the data, you will receive `count` to allow you to paginate accordingly.
