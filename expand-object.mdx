title: "Expand object"
---

Many objects allow you to request additional information as an expanded response by using the `expand` request parameter.
This parameter is available on all API requests, and applies to the response of that request only.

In many cases, an object contains the ID of a related object in its response properties.
For example, a `Customer` may have an associated `Organization` ID.
Those objects can be expanded inline with the `expand` request parameter.

You can use the `expand` param on any list endpoint which returns expandable fields.

You can expand multiple objects at once by identifying multiple items in the expand array.

Be aware that using expand will make your queries slower.
